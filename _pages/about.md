Hi, I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computing at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University ([PolyU, 香港理工大学](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/en/)) in Hong Kong SAR, supervised by [Prof. Jingcai Guo](https://jingcaiguo.github.io/). Prior to that, I received my M.Eng. degree (2024) from the School of Information and Communication Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China ([UESTC, 电子科技大学](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/3974ba6dfa50d5c04a9414d3ce8bfd34.html?n=8e7z368tn51)) in Chengdu, China, supervised by [Prof. Ling Wang](https://faculty.uestc.edu.cn/eewangling/zh_CN/index.htm). I also received my B.Sc. degree (2021) in Electronic Information Science and Technology from the School of Physics, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China ([UESTC, 电子科技大学](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/3974ba6dfa50d5c04a9414d3ce8bfd34.html?n=8e7z368tn51)). Concurrently I obtained a B.B.A. degree (2021) in Business Administration from the School of Management and Economics, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China ([UESTC, 电子科技大学](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/3974ba6dfa50d5c04a9414d3ce8bfd34.html?n=8e7z368tn51)) at the same period. 

My research interests include **Human Action Recognition**, **Zero/Few-shot Learning**, and **AI+Healthcare**. If you share similar interests or are open to discussing academic research, please feel free to email me at [cseeychen@gmail.com](). I believe this form of mutual learning will create new opportunities for interesting research, benefiting all of us.
